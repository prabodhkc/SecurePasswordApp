# Secure Password Generator

A simple web-based password generator that creates secure passwords with customizable options, such as length, inclusion of uppercase letters, and symbols. The app generates random passwords that are difficult to guess, providing a higher level of security for user accounts.

## Features
- **Password Length**: Choose a password length between 6 and 64 characters.
- **Uppercase Letters**: Option to include uppercase letters in the password.
- **Symbols**: Option to include symbols for additional complexity.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: One-click copy feature to copy the generated password to the clipboard.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styles the layout, making it clean and user-friendly.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the password generation logic and user interaction.

## How It Works
1. The user can select the desired password length and toggle the options to include uppercase letters and symbols.
2. Once the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, the JavaScript function generates a password based on the selected criteria.
3. The generated password is displayed in a read-only input field.
4. The user can copy the password to the clipboard by clicking the "Copy to Clipboard" button.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: Contains the structure and layout of the web page.
- `style.css`: Provides the styling for the page.
- `script.js`: Contains the logic for generating the password and handling user interactions.

## How I Built It
- **HTML**: I created a basic HTML structure with an input field for displaying the password, checkboxes for the options, and buttons for generating the password and copying it to the clipboard.
- **CSS**: The page was styled to be simple and intuitive. I used flexbox for centering the content and added some basic styling for buttons and input fields.
- **JavaScript**: I wrote a function that dynamically creates a pool of characters based on the user's options (lowercase, uppercase, symbols). The password is then generated by randomly selecting characters from this pool. I also implemented the copy-to-clipboard functionality using the `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` API.

## Demo
You can see a live demo of the project by opening `index.html` in your browser. Use the options to generate and copy a secure password.
